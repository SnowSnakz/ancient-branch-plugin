# The Ancient Branch
This is the code for a plugin which is developed and maintained by the Ancient Branch Minecraft server.

Feel free to submit any bug fixed or attempt to write code for feature requests if you would like to, any help is 
appreciated!

## Our Server
We are running a server called Ancient Branch, it is inspired by a Universe that I (Woof Hybrid) designed in my head
over the course of a good few years...

At the time of writing this, the only people actively working on the server are ChiverQuiver and Woof Hybrid.\
Some help was provided by TheOnlyDuck6 and SpicyChicken.

The server is not public yet. I don't plan on making the server public until it is either complete, or really close to
being complete.

## How do I use this?
Some setup might be required on your end. Whenever I can be bothered, I might write a guide for this. 
Please note that this plugin isn't really being designed with other servers in mind.
Some things might be hard-coded and otherwise not very configurable.

The abstractions that currently exist and might exist in the future is mostly to reduce code duplication and hopefully
also make it easier to create new features that are functionally similar to existing features.
